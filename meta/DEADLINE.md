## Part 1.1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

I created an app that will first prompt the user to put in a meal they enjoy. The computer will
take that meal and, using the first API, will find the first ten ingredients in that recipe. If there are
less than  10 ingredients, only those will be shown. Next, using the second API, the computer will find
new meals that that can be made using those ingredients given from the first API.

## Part 1.2: APIs

> For each RESTful JSON API that your app uses (at least two are required),
> include an example URL for a typical request made by your app. If you
> need to include additional notes (e.g., regarding API keys or rate
> limits), then you can do that below the URL/URI. Placeholders for this
> information are provided below. If your app uses more than two RESTful
> JSON APIs, then include them with similar formatting.

### API 1

```
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=Pizza
```

> Replace this line with notes (if needed) or remove it (if not needed).

### API 2

```
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=chicken
```

> Replace this line with notes (if needed) or remove it (if not needed).

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Something I learned was how to find and implement new APIs. Before this project, I would need
to be given the API and explained how to use it but now I have figured out how to do it
by myself.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I had to restart this project from scratch, I would make sure I knew which APIs I was using from the beginning.
Multiple times during this project I changed which API I was using because I would get confused on
how the original worked. This led to multiple hours wasted on trying to figure the APIs out and which one would work best.
